- [x] property/subscript
- [ ] Binary operator

- [ ] complex literal types: array, tuple, set, dictionary, closure (function without arglist)
- [ ] write core functions in vsl e.g. `if`/`else`, `for`, `while`/``do_while`/`do <body> while <condition>`
- [ ] list + dictionary comprehensions
- [ ] function flags + decorators (do the same thing)

## Miscellaneous things, low priority
- [ ] use `readFile` from `fs-promise` again, for some reason readFile bork
- [ ] Don't use strings for constant tokens
- [ ] Since nearley does not give sufficient info, create lexemes that match incorrect grammar and return an ErrorNode or something with details
- [ ] Fork nearley and make generated js (BUT only do this after the major update)
